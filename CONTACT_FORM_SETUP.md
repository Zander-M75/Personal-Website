## Troubleshooting

**Form not sending?**
- Make sure you replaced `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual key
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify your email in Web3Forms is correct

**Not receiving emails?**
- Check spam folder
- Verify the email address in Web3Forms dashboard
- Test with a different email to rule out spam filters

**Getting CORS errors?**
- This shouldn't happen with Web3Forms, but if it does, make sure you're using `https://api.web3forms.com/submit` (not http)
